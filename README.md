# Comparison of Merge-sort, Heapsort and Quicksort
## Comparison of run-times

The aim of Comparison-of-Merge-sort-Heapsort-and-Quicksort is to implement,test and compare to three sorting algorithm. This algorithms was compared according to equal,random,increasing,decreasing integers(1000,10000,100000) data and results were reported.
